##EDITORS NOTE:
The original [`story memo pitch`](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-4PJvO7rgbHQxcUo0KTAEOclYkpNj7_4mKKRHsbejE4/edit#slide=id.p) suggested the idea to present a data chart comparing sales reports for the popular retailers, Lululemon and Nike. I made a public records request to the private data analytics company Earnest Research to see if they would be willing to release information to me as a student but haven’t received a response.

I assume it’s harder to retrieve numbers from private companies such as Nike, unless I paid for it. Thus, I decided to move on and focus my story on a broader source of data I pulled from [`Census`](https://www.census.gov/econ/currentdata/dbsearch?program=MRTS&startYear=2019&endYear=2020&categories=44814&dataType=SM&geoLevel=US&notAdjusted=1&submit=GET+DATA&releaseScheduleId=). 
MONTHLY RETAIL TRADE AND FOOD SERVICES > 2019-2020 > 44811: MENS CLOTHING STORES > NOT SEASONALLY ADJUSTED > GET DATA
Repeat steps for womens and family clothings stores

In this revised data story, I compare the number of sales in millions for men’s, women’s, and family clothing stores and how they were doing last year versus now, during the pandemic. I chose to use the “not seasonally adjusted sales” and will only be comparing the numbers from Jan - Mar of 2019 and this year, since that’s what was readily available.
