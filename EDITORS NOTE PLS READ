The original story memo pitch suggested the idea to present a data chart comparing sales reports for the popular retailers, Lululemon and Nike. 
I made a public records request to the private data analytics company Earnest Research to see if they would be willing to release information to me as a student but haven’t received a response.
I assume it’s harder to retrieve numbers from private companies such as Nike, unless I paid for it. 
Thus, I decided to move on and focus my story on a broader source of data I pulled from Census. 
In this revised data story, I compare the number of sales in millions for men’s, women’s, and family clothing stores and how they were doing last year versus now, during the pandemic. 
I chose to use the “not seasonally adjusted sales” and will only be comparing the numbers from Jan - Mar of 2019 and this year, since that’s what was readily available.
